### Excerpt from Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas by [[Antonio de Morga]]
- the excerpt was very biased. Morga was already looking at a perspective of being a christian when he started to describe what the non-christian natives do to pray, who they worshiped, and etc.
- When it came to describing any type of religious worship of the natives, he describes it with bias.
- "... These (catalonas) were experienced witches and sorcerers, who kept other people decieved... the catalonas told them extravagances and lies.
- "...  and they used various kinds of divinations for all things. All this with so little aid, apparatus, or foundation which God permitted."
