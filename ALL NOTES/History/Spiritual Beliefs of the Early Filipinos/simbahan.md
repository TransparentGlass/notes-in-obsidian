[[simbahan]] existed because formerly, when they wished to celebrate festival (pandot or worship), they'd shelter in the chief's large house to protect them from rain. They constructed a temporary shed on each side of the house, with a roof called *sibi*, to protect from the rain.

Designed like ships, divided in 3 compartments. On the posts of the house, they set up lamps (sorihile). In the center, they placed one large lamp with white palm wrought in design. Drums were played while the feast lasted. Everyone in the [[barangay]] is united and joined in the worship which they call [[nagaanitos]]. 

Now the chief's house is a temple.
