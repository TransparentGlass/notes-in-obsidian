# Description
Supposed legal code (set of laws) in the epic history of Maragtas written in 1433 by Datu Kalantiaw, giving him the title "the first Philippine lawgiver". Evidence provided by [[Jose E. Marco]] included the document [[Las antiguas leyendas de la Isla de Negros]] (English: The Ancient Legends of the Island of Negros).

Historians, namely [[William Henry Scott]], found out that the documents supporting its existence were fabrications from [[Jose E. Marco]] in his book *Historia Prehispana Filipinas* (prehispanic history of the Philippines).

The National Historical Institute corrected this and declared a Hall of Fame and Library to be constructed in his Honor in Batan, Aklan.
