## Notes
- A __letter__ that is written by the person during the period is a **prime example** of a primary source.
	- Example of this is the reproduction of Andres Bonifacio's letter to Emilio Jacinto.
	- Documents, archival materials, letters, government records, etc.
	- Can also be non-written like physical artifacts/objects
- Documents of the past can be forgery. Studying history includes verifying these documents to be authentic.
	- Example of this is [[Jose E. Marco]].
- **Secondary Sources** are works produced *after the event.* They use primary sources to create secondary sources.
	- Examples: Textbooks, [[Monographs]], essays, articles, etc.

### Historical Method
- Two components of historical method are: External and internal criticisms.
- **External criticism** aims to check if the source is real or fake. Does it belong to its time period. 
	- Example of this is the study made by [[William Henry Scott]] that proved that [[Code of Kalantiaw]] was a forgery made by [[Jose E. Marco]]. Study showed that the hand writing used by Fr. Pavon
- **Internal criticism** aims to check if the source is reliable and asks;
	1. How close was the author to the event?
	   - This asks if they witnessed it or rely on somebody's report.
	2. When was the account made?
	3. Who was the recipient of the account?
	4. Is there bias?
	5. Does it make sense (is it probable)?
	6. Is the account [[corroborated]] by other accounts?
