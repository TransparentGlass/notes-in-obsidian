What happens when poverty persists in the PH?

## Background context of the current state of poverty in the Philippines
- Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs like food, clothing and shelter.
- According to the Philippines statistics Authority (PSA), a family of five members needs at least approximately 14,000 Pesos per month to meet basic minimum food and non food needs in 2023. That is around 168,000 pesos per year or 500 pesos per day. Which is minimum wage for a working adult in the Philippines.

## 3 Major Causes of Poverty

While poverty is a complex issue with numerous contributing factors, three major causes often stand out:

1. **Economic Inequality:** This refers to the unequal distribution of wealth and resources within a society. 
	- When a small percentage of the population holds a disproportionate amount of wealth, it can lead to limited opportunities and perpetuate poverty for the majority. 

1. **Lack of Education:** Education is a powerful tool for breaking the cycle of poverty. Limited access to quality education can hinder individuals' ability to secure better-paying jobs and improve their livelihoods.

2. **Lack of Healthcare:** Adequate healthcare is essential for maintaining good health and productivity. When people cannot afford necessary medical treatment, it can lead to financial hardship and further exacerbate poverty.

### What will happen to the Philippines if poverty will still occur?
- A study made by the Asian Development Bank (2009), says that the poor will only get poorer due to:
	1. Health
		- People stuck in poverty have a harder time to be more productive and more competitive to get out of poverty. Being in the poverty trap, you most likely have less than you need like food, medications, etc. to compete for higher pay.
	2. Education
		- Most people stuck in poverty is unlikely to finish senior high school. Thus, not being able to get a more higher paying job. This extends through generations, using their children to generate money to provide for their needs but not enough to put their children into education and not able to because of the work the children has to do. 
	3. Opportunities
		- Not being able to loan due to the lack of social credit, not being able to invest due to the lack of funds, everything. According to ADB (2009), evidence shows that people are more untrusting towards the poorer individuals. Money seems to be the one thing that is stopping poverty stricken individuals from rising from poverty itself. 
If not stopped, not only the poorer communities will not be able to get out of generational poverty it would also affect the philippines by:
**Poverty can have a big negative impact on a country:**

- **Economy:** It can slow down economic growth.
- **Society:** It can lead to problems like crime and unrest.
- **People:** It can make it hard for people to get good jobs and education.
- **Government:** It can make the government weak and unstable.
- **Environment:** It can hurt the environment.
- **Safety:** It can make the country more vulnerable to problems.

So, it's important to address poverty to help a country be strong and successful.
